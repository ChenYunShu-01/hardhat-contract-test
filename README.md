# Harthad Contract Test

Test ERC20 & ERC721 contract using hardhat.

## Getting Started

It's very important to test contracts before they are going to be deployed on mainnet. To test our contract, we are going to use Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network designed for development. You can also view the test coverage report generated by the tool hardhat coverage.

### Prerequisites

* nodejs
* npm
* hardhat

### Installation

```
$ npm install --save-dev hardhat
$ npm install --save-dev solidity-coverage
```

## Usage

A few examples of useful commands and/or tasks.

```
$ npx hardhat compile
$ npx hardhat run <js file>
$ npx hardhat test
$ npx hardhat coverage
```
